#### Due: 2/9/18

__This assignment is to be handed in during class on 2/9/18. If you have any questions, please post to Piazza or contact one of the TAs!__

Suppose we are using a histogram filter to localize a robot on a 2D grid of tiles. Each tile can be either white or black. For this homework, we will only care about the subsection of the environment displayed below.

What is the belief distribution for this world, given the robot knows it starts somewhere in the 2x3 subsection defined above? Please fill in below. Either give fractions or round to 2 decimal places.

We sense that we are in a black space. The sensor is correct 80% of the time. Calculate the posterior below (make sure you normalize). Show your calculations.

Now we move south east by one space (diagonally to the right and down). Let us say that there is a 0.84 chance that we end up in the desired spot, but a (1 - 0.84) / 8 = 0.02 chance we end up in any of the 8 surrounding squares. What is the probability that we end up in the middle square of the top row? Show your calculations.
