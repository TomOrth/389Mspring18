Let us say we have a 2D world that looks like the following.

What is the probability distribution for this world? Please fill in below. Either give fractions or round to 2 decimal places.

We define pHit = 0.8 and pMiss = 0.2. We sense that we are in a black space. Please update the probability distribution (make sure you normalize).

Now we move right. Let us say that there is a 0.84 chance that we end up in the desired spot, but a (1 - 0.84) / 8 = 0.02 chance we end up in any of the 8 surrounding squares.

What is the probability that we end up in the middle square of the top row? Please show your calculations.
