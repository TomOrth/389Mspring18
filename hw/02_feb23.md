#### Due: 3/9/18

__This assignment is to be handed in during class on 3/2/18. If you have any questions, please post to Piazza or contact one of the TAs!__

__UPDATE 3/6: This assignment is due on 3/9 because school was closed on 3/2.__

#### Prediction Step
Let's say we are tracking a robot in a 1D world. We know that our prior distribution has a μ of 8 and σ of 1. The motion model for movement is the robot moves 3 to the right with a standard deviation of 2. What are the mean and standard deviation of the new distribution after the prediction step?

#### Measurement Step
After you've calculated this, we get a measurement that we are at 10 with a standard deviation of 1. What are the mean and standard deviation of the new distribution after the measurement step?

#### Standard Deviation
What happens to the standard deviation after the movement update? What happens to the standard deviation after the sensing update? Why?

#### Kalman vs. Histogram
Discuss the pros and cons of using a Kalman Filter vs. Histogram Filter.
