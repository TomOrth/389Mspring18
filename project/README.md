# Project 1: Histogram Filter
![](https://i.imgur.com/N6srxnr.png)
## Introduction
In this project you will write a Histogram Filter for a 2D simulated environment. The simulation consists of a car, a maze to navigate through, and randomly distributed landmarks (shown in green) that the robot can use to localize. The robot's belief distribution is drawn over the simulation (shown above in red). Once the simulation is started you can control the robot's motion with the arrow keys. Once you correctly impliment the Histogram Filter your robot should be able to localize itself as you navigate through the maze with the arrow keys. Public tests are provided to help you develop the filter.

## Your Task
All simulation code has been provided and should not be modified. If you find a problem, please make a piazza post to notify us. Skeleton code for the Histogram Filter has been provided in 'histfilter.py'; make all your modifications in this file. Below you will find the specifications for the motion and sensor models to use in the project. Though you could come up with your own, perfectly valid models, it is important that you impliment the models the way they are specified below so you pass the public tests and your project is graded correctly.
