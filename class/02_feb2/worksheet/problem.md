## Total Probability + Bayes' Rule
#### 2/1/18 Worksheet: CMSC389M

### Total Probability

We need to figure out the probability that Kayla is on her phone.

Let’s say Kayla can exist in three places: the library, her dorm, and McKeldin fountain. There’s a 0.2 chance she’s at the library, 0.4 chance she’s at her dorm, and a 0.4 chance she’s in McKeldin fountain.

If she’s at the library, there’s a 0.9 chance she’s on her phone.
If she’s at her dorm, there’s a 0.6 chance she’s on her phone.
If she’s in the fountain, there’s a 0.1 chance she’s on her phone.

__What is the probability she’s NOT on her phone?__

### Bayes' Rule

Let us say that there is a 0.01 chance Megan is doing homework at any given time.

We know that if she is doing homework, we can expect her to be tired with a probability of 0.9. However, if she is not doing homework, we can expect her to be tired with a probability of 0.2. 

__What is the probability she is doing homework given she is tired?__
